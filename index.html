    <h1>Finding Joy In Cooking Again</h1>
    <p>Over the last few years, I have lost the joy in food and cooking due to major depression. I lost sight of who I am and what makes me happy. In this journey or learning web development.    </p>
    <p>I have found joy in many aspects in my life again. Obviously a big one is that I just love to learn. Learning HTML and building these projects have been so fun.</p>
    <p>Watching and cooking food has been re-introduced into my life without guilt. Although my weekly cooking will be still bulk, bro meals. I intend to actually "cook" a meal once a week.</p>
    <p>It's possible that this commitment to cooking once a week will also help restore relationships in my life. Follow along my journey as a self-taught web developer and finding joy in life.</p>
