    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have chosen the Egg Sando Filling recipe from the one and only Doobydobap. A delicious creamy and savoury mixture of eggs, kewpie mayo and some S&P.Egg sandos filling is a reocurring staple in my breakfasts. The reason I say the filling itself is a staple and not just a sando is because I often rotate the carbs that go along the egg sando filling.
    Typically alternating between rice, toast, naan, and sometimnes just straight up filling. That stuff is bomb af.
