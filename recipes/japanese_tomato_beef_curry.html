    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another mouth watering recipe from D. This gives me canto tomato egg vibes! I'm definitely going to try making a big batch of this next.
         After that I'll probably try add scrambled egg to it as well just like the canto style to see how the flavours meld together. DON'T YUCK MY YUM!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet Japanese Curry Roux</li>
        <li>250g thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 can whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li> 500ml water of stock (add more depending on consistency)</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper to season</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tbsp butter and oil in a heavy-duty pot.</li>
        <li>Caramelize the onions on medium-low heat stirring constantly. This should take around 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the onion has carmelized, add the beef and cook until it gets color.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and water to deglaze the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot. (Alternatively, add pureed tomatoes if you prefer a smoother consistency)</li>
        <li>Once the mixture comes to a rolling boil, add the curry roux packet. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Add ketchup and finish off the butter. Serve with white rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
